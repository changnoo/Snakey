# Snake Game

I am in the process of picking up C/C++ again and I thought it would be a good idea to start by building a simple game using simple data structures and control flow

# Features

As shown above, the game consists of a small rectangular area for the snake to roam.
Notable features include:
 - randomized "fruit" generation
 - score addition
 - relatively smooth tail generation and follow through
 - wall pass through

# What I've learned
I have not used C/C++ in a couple of years so this project was a great simple project for me to rekindle my interest in programming, learn basics, and practice debugging.
Notable things I learned by completing this project include:
- headers/libraries
- data types/structures
- functions
- loops
- switch/case statements
